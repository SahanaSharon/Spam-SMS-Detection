It helps in filtering unwanted or fraudulent messages, improving communication safety and efficiency.

✨ Features

📨 Classifies SMS messages into Spam or Ham

🤖 Built using Machine Learning models (Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression / Random Forest etc.)

🔍 Uses NLP techniques (Tokenization, Stopwords removal, TF-IDF vectorization)

📊 Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics

🌐 Can be integrated into apps, email systems, or chat services

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python – Core programming

Scikit-learn – Machine learning models

NLTK / SpaCy – Natural Language Processing

Pandas, NumPy – Data preprocessing

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization
